  "body": "# Azure DevTest Labs Community\r\nThis is a public, community-contributed repository that contains:\r\n- **Artifacts for Azure DevTest Labs:** These artifacts can be deployed onto VMs in Azure DevTest Labs in the new Azure portal.\r\n\r\n- **Azure Resource Manager Quickstart Templates for Azure DevTest Labs:** These templates help with creation and deployment of resources related to Azure DevTest Labs (e.g. Labs, VMs and VM templates etc).\r\n- **Open Source Code of Conduct:** This project has adopted the [Microsoft Open Source Code of Conduct](https://opensource.microsoft.com/codeofconduct/). For more information see the [Code of Conduct FAQ](https://opensource.microsoft.com/codeofconduct/faq/) or contact [opencode@microsoft.com](mailto:opencode@microsoft.com) with any additional questions or comments.\r\n\r\n---\r\n### Artifacts Authoring:\r\n- Please see the document ['AUTHORING'](Documentation/AUTHORING.md) in the Documentation folder for details.\r\n\r\nContributions guidelines:\r\n- Every artifact should be contained in its own **folder** under the **Artifacts** folder.\r\n\r\n- The artifact definition file should be named **Artifactfile.json**. The name of the artifact that shows up in Azure DevTest Labs is from the title field in the artifact definition.\r\n\r\n- All dependencies of the artifact (such as scripts, icons etc) should be included in the artifact folder itself.\r\n\r\n- All references to icons must use SSL, otherwise they will not load in the Azure portal.\r\n\r\n- It is highly recommended that a **Readme.md** file be included to explain how the artifact works and how to troubleshoot any failures.\r\n\r\n- For authors who create the artifact and take responsibility of maintaining it, it is encouraged to add your name in the \"publisher\" field while authoring artifacts.   \r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\n### Azure Resource Manager Quickstart Templates\r\n- The latest, *developer* versions of the Azure Resource Manager Quickstart Templates for Azure DevTest Labs can be found in the ['ARMTemplates'](ARMTemplates) folder of this repo.\r\n\r\n---\r\n### Miscellaneous\r\n\r\nSome useful scripts, related to Azure DevTest labs can be found in the ['scripts'](../../tree/master/Scripts) folder.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
